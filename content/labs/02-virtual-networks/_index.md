In this lab, I'll works with virtual networks using the libvirt service.

## Step 01 - Modify Network Settings
I can use the virsh or virt-manager applications to change a virtual network's configuration.

## Step 02 - Create Isolated Networks
I'll create new virtual networks that are isolated from the internet, unlike the NAT-mode default virtual network.

## Step 03 - Capture Packets
I can use the Wireshark packet capture application to study the packets being sent on the virtual networks.
